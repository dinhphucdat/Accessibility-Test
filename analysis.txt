___________________ ANALYSIS OF THE TESTING RESULT _________________________


1. Which category/categories are the accessibility checkers best at identifying errors
for (e.g. have the highest ratio of errors found to errors possible)?

--> Based on the table, we can see that Title is best at identifying errors, with the 
success ratio up to 66.7 percent

2. Which category/categories are the accessibility checkers worst at identifying
errors for (e.g. have the lowest ratio of errors found to errors possible)?

--> Based on the table, we can see that Layout and Navigation are worst at identifying 
errors, with zero success ratio.

3. Select one of the tests that is shown in the showAllFailed and describe what the issue is
and how it can affect a person with a disability.

--> One of the tests that failed all 4 checkers is:
	
	[Language: Text language is in the wrong direction |GOOGLE: notfound |WAVE: notfound 
	|SORTSITE: notfound |ASLINT: notfound]

--> How it negatively affects the disabled: If the text language is printed backward or printed 
where it should rarely be, even a normal person cannot expect the text to be there, so such a 
text is not adequately informative. For example, when an instruction manual has an "attention" 
section but it hides somewhere else that the reader can never expect, there is a chance that 
the reader can omit it and hence destroy the products just because they never know there are some 
notices they had to know to protect the products beforehand. This case is even worse when applied 
to people with disability, especially when it comes to people with degraded brain functions, or even 
people suffering from OCD or ADHD, since it is really hard for them to make sure they have scanned 
through all the texts they are supposed to read. The only way to improve these errors is that we 
need to identify as many errors as possible through some detecting tools, but in this case all 
checker failed at detecting such errors, so if we let such propagate to the public, we could 
observe negative effects.

4. Reflect: How does this assignment shape your understanding of computer science?

--> Computer Science entails working with a junk of data and from that data analysis, 
what conclusion we can draw. This is a massive and intertwining work between 
Computer Science and Data Science, but Computer Science works more on the algorithms 
to process the data into a friendlier form so the analyzers can use it at ease. Data 
Science builds different kinds of statistic tests to check the validity of data. 
Hence, Computer Science is not just about building softwares or games, but there are 
also some more pathways where Computer Scientists never discovered, but they have 
still been there and needed labors.
